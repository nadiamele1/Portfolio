<div class="swiper">
  <div class="swiper-wrapper">
    <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="Dataverzameling-1.png" alt="Slide 1" width="500px" height="auto"><p>In this illustration I wanted to give an insight of my screentime during a free week. Screentime can be seen as playing games, watching some movies/series, social media, but it can also be seen as a videocall with my friends.</p></div>
    <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="Dataverzameling-2.png" alt="Slide 2" width="800px" height="auto"><p>Since this year I've started gym, this is something that I've procrastinated for a bit too long. In this illustration you can see some guys some of them ar actually lifting some weights (these are the days I go to the gym), while others are resting (these symbolise the days I don't go to the gym).</p></div>
    <div class="swiper-slide"><span class="derdefoto"><img src="Dataverzameling-3.png" alt="Slide 3" width="600px" height="auto"><p>My favourute thing to do is going coffee hopping with my best friend. My go to drink is an iced latte, that's why i decided to draw 7 iced lattes (one for each day in a week). Every ice cube is a coffe I drink during that day.</p></span></div>
    <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="Dataverzameling-4.png" alt="Slide 4" width="500px" height="auto"><p>Something that characterizes me is that every week, on every Saturday, we eat pizza. This is something we've done my whole life. I am Italian and when i used to live in italy it was kind of like a tradition, this is something we kept even after we moved in Belgium.The pizza has 7 slices, one is not there anymore, this symbolises that we eat pizza once a week.</p></div>
    <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="Dataverzameling-5.png" alt="Slide 5" width="500px" height="auto"><p>This illustration symbo me going on a walk with my dog, Lana. In a day, we try and take her out at least two times, but this is not aways. </p></div>
