    <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="Dataverzameling-1.png" alt="Slide 1" width="500px" height="auto"><p>In this illustration I wanted to give an insight of my screentime during a free week. Screentime can be seen as playing games, watching some movies/series, social media, but it can also be seen as a videocall with my friends.</p></div>
    <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="Dataverzameling-2.png" alt="Slide 2" width="800px" height="auto"><p>This year I have started going to the gym, which was something that I had been procrastinating for a bit too long. In this illustration you can see different figures: some of them are lifting weights (these are the days I go to the gym), while others are resting (these symbolise the days I don't go to the gym).</p></div>
    <div class="swiper-slide"><span class="derdefoto"><img src="Dataverzameling-3.png" alt="Slide 3" width="600px" height="auto"><p>My favourite thing to do is going coffee hopping with my best friend. My go to drink is an iced latte, that's why i decided to draw 7 iced lattes (one for each day in a week). Every ice cube is a coffee I drink during that day.</p></span></div>
    <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="Dataverzameling-4.png" alt="Slide 4" width="500px" height="auto"><p>Something that characterizes me is that every week, on every Saturday, I eat pizza. I am Italian and when I used to live in Italy it was kind like a tradition. I kept on doing it even after we moved to Belgium. The pizza of the illustration has six slices, since one is not there anymore. Each slices symbolisez one day of the week and the missing slice is the one on which we eat the pizza.</p></div>
    <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="Dataverzameling-5.png" alt="Slide 5" width="500px" height="auto"><p>This illustration symbolises me going on a walk with my dog, Lana. During the day, we try and take her out at least twice, but this is not always possible. </p></div>
